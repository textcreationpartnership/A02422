            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>what ſo euer folow, I wyll alwaye graunte this, that the trauth of the fayth, is the trauth of chryſt. For yf there were any artycle, wherin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trauth of chryſte were not. I am ſure, it coude be no parte of his fayth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Doutles, it is very well taken: wherfore yf that trauth, which is in euery ſyngular artycle of the fayth, be the very trauth of chryſt (as there is no fayle, but it is in dede / or els were they vtterly no partes of his fayth, as thou doeſt
<pb facs="tcp:3749:17"/>
full trewly confeſſe thy ſelfe) thou ſhalt be therfore well anſwered, it muſt clerely folowe, that chryſt is alſo, in euery article of his fayth. For chryſt and his trauth, be not two thynges, as other men be, and theyr trauth, whiche are oft tymes without it: ſome men may, (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme at leeſt) be ſayde to be trewe. But no man may (at any tyme) be ſayde to be trauth: which is proper to chryſt: for iuſtly may he, and no man ellys, be called trauth: for ſo doth he call hym ſelfe:<note place="margin">Iob. 1</note> and doutles the cauſe why? is this, that he and it, is all one: for as thou conſyderſt no chryſte, when thou conſyderſt trauth without hym: euen ſo thou conſyderſt no chryſt nother, when thou conſyderſte hym, withoute trauth: for wythout trauth, what were he but no chryſte in dede.
<pb facs="tcp:3749:18"/>
Therfore what ſo euer thynges cle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue ſo togyther, that they can not be ſeparate, nother in dede, nor yet in conſyderacyon, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out fayle agayne all reaſon it were to ſay, that they be dyuers. But ſurely euen ſuche is chryſt, and his trauth. wherfore it were wyckedneſſe, to thynke, that they be not bothe one. This ineui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table concluſyon well marked, and borne in mynde, ſhall cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clerly to perceyue thoſe thynges, whiche muſt nedes folow therof. Now ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore whyle it is ſo, that the trauth of chryſt, is in euery artycle of his fayth, &amp; he &amp; his trauth is both one: it can not be auoyded, but alſo he, which is his trouth, is in euery one of them: for yf he be not in them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (bycauſe his trauth &amp; he is all one) his trauth is not i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: if his truath be not in them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be not trew
<pb facs="tcp:3749:18"/>
yf they be not trew / then, they be no artycles of his fayth. But bycauſe all this is fals: now agayne to the trewe parte: yf they be articles of his fayth / then doutles his trauth is in them: yf his trauth be in them then without queſtyon ſo is he: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou wolt make hym, without his trauth, as it muſt nedes folow, yf he be not where it is, the whiche were impoſſyble. Now is it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, clerely come to lyght, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> chryſt is in euery artycle of his fayth. wherof (as thou mayeſt perceyue thy ſelfe) it can not be auoyded, but who ſo euer denyeth, any one of them (as euery heretike doth, at the leſt) he doeth alſo denye hym in the ſame. And therfore what parte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayth leuyth he vndenyed, whiche denieth hym, in whome there is all conteyned? A more larger declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon

<pb facs="tcp:3749:24"/>
be ſo to: when it is euer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary: for yf thou wylt haue the trauth of eche article to dyffer, as the articles doth themſelf, in whom it is. Thou ſhalt make neuer a one of them trew.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>He.</speaker>
               <p>yet that wolde I heare.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>with a good wyll. If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trauth of the reſurrection, and the trauth of the aſcention, were not all one: it coude not be anoyded / but the one trauth muſt nedes dyffer from the other. And then, yf the one dyffer from the other / bycauſe that ſame other is trauth, the one muſt nedes dyffer from trauth. And (as I tolde the before) what ſo euer differth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trauth / all men knoweth is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyble to be trauth. Therfore by this reaſon, the one article is without trauth. And alſo by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame reaſon, lykewyſe the tother, of the contrary part / and ſo altogyther. Moreouer
<pb facs="tcp:3749:24"/>
agayne this waye, yf they were two trauthes / there is no dout, but the one, were not the ſame, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other is. Then yf the one, were not the ſame that the other is / bycauſe the other is trauth: the one were not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame that is trauth. And what ſo euer is not the ſame, that is trauth, without fayle, can be no trauthe. Therfore if they be twayne, the one is no trauth nor the other nother. Beſyde all this: the trauth of euery artycle, is (as I ſayd) the trauth of chryſt / and byeauſe chryſte and his trauth is all one, yf there be not the very ſame trauth, in one article, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in a nother, it muſt nedes folow, that there is not the ſame chryſt in one article, that is in a nother / but in euery article a dyuerſe chryſt, ſo that there be ſo many chryſtes, as there be artycles: wherfore, bycauſe
<pb facs="tcp:3749:25"/>
the falſhed of theſe concluſyons, is not onely to odyble to be heard, but alſo to playne to be douted in. The trauth therfore, of the reſurrection, muſt nedes be (as it is in dede) the very ſame, all one, and none other, but euen the very trauth of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention. And ſo it is lykewyſe to be ſayd, and vnderſtande, of ech arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle from one to a nother, thorough all the hole fayth. Therfore when the trauthe (as I haue playnely ſhowed the) is no more in the hole fayth, then in the leſt part of it / nor no leſſe, in the leeſt part, then in all the hole to gyther: nor none other, in one part, then in any of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other. To this it muſte nedes come, that the hole trauth, of the hole fayth, is in eche and euery ſyngulare parte of it / no more, no leſſe, none other, but without any dyfference, euen
<pb facs="tcp:3749:25"/>
the very ſame. wherfore bycauſe it is ſo, and can in dede, none other wyſe be: this is therof a concluſyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ineuitable / that who ſo euer deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any article of the fayth (as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heretyke doeth one or other at leeſt) he denieth vtterly the hole trauth of all togyther: for who ſo euer denieth a part of that, whych hath no partes, denieth in dede all the hole, bycauſe the very ſame, which ſemeth a part, is all the hole And ſuch is the trauth of the fayth which (all though it be nothyng ſo) yet ſemeth to haue partes, &amp; all by the reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dyuerſyte of thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, wherin it is: that is to ſay, by the reaſon that the fayth is deuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into dyuers diſtyncte artycles, wherin the trauth of it is. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe why it is thought, (of ſuch as vnderſtond it not) that
<pb facs="tcp:3749:26"/>
the trauth it ſelfe (which is indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyble) is alſo dyuyded and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes dyſtributed amonge them lyke wyſe, the whiche is vtterly fals. Therfore fyrmely ſtyll abydeth my ſayenge, that all heretykes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, not onely in thoſe articles which they denie, but alſo in thoſe which they graunte and confeſſe, when it is ſurely ſo / that they denie ciene contrary and agaynſte theyr owne thynkyng, the very trauth of all togyther.</p>

               <p>Thou ſhalt ſe me go nere it by &amp; by. Thou doeſt not knowe (I perceyue) that a thynge is denyed, two maner of wayes, dyrectely, and indyrectely: that is to ſaye by meane, and imedyately / by the reaſon wherof, a thyng may ſeme ſometyme, to be graunted, when it is denyed / as it doth now in this caſe. For by the waye of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſample. One Fotyne an heretike in tyme paſt, ſemyd to confeſſe chryſt dyrectely, when he dyd ſo ſaye and none other wyſe thynke. But yet he dyd vtterly denye the ſame indyrec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tely, when he dyde bothe ſaye and
<pb facs="tcp:3749:29"/>
thynke that he was not very gode for none other is chryſte, but one perſon, god and man ioyned togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therfore yf he were not god, in very dede he were not chryſte. wherfore when he denyed hym dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectely to be god / he dyde vtterly denye hym indyrectely, to be chryſt: that is to ſaye, he dyde therin denye hym to be chryſt, by meane / the whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che is none other, but ſo to ſaye, or ſpeke ſuch thynges of hym. wherof it muſt nedes folow, that he can not be chryſte. wherfore, yf chryſte be denied, whether it be dyrectely, or indyrectely, it is no mater, when all cometh to one, before hym, that can playnely perceyue, and ſe it / &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is alwaye god at leſte, all though there were no man els, that coulde, as the moſte parte in dede can not. Therfore as the Fotyns denyed
<pb facs="tcp:3749:29"/>
chryſt to be very god. So the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niches denied hym to be very man. wherin they both, denied hym to be very chryſt, all though not directe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: that is to ſaye, all though they bothe ſayde and thought the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But what for that / when of eche, of theyr ſayenges, no chryſte muſt nedes folowe? For lyke as he is not chryſt, yf he be not very god / ſo he is not chryſte nother, yf he be not very man. when chryſt is (as I ſayde) none other, but one ſyngular parſon, of bothe god and man ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togyther. wherfore, they denied in dede, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very ſame thynge, which they ſemed bothe to graunte. And dyd not thoſe, whiche denied chryſt to be a very man, denie therin, his very natiuite, denie therin, his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſurrection, denie therin, his ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry aſcention? what yf they dyd not
<pb facs="tcp:3749:30"/>
thynke it? what is all that, to the purpoſe: which of thoſe artycles, coude be trewe, yf chryſt were not a very man? for he that denieth one artycle, all though with his word, and alſo thought, he graunte an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / yet in very dede for all that, he doth denie them bothe togyther, the tone directely, and the tother in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyrectely, whiche maketh no dyffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the concluſyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For as ſure is the tone as the tother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for all though he ſaye, and more ouer ſo thynke, the tone to be trew (as it is in dede) yet when the trauth of the ſame, is alſo in the tother, which he directely denieth. Clere it is, that he denyeth the ſame to, whiche he ſemeth and alſo weneth hym ſelfe to graunte: when he denyeth the very trauth of it in the tother. For the thynge can neuer abyde, where
<pb facs="tcp:3749:30"/>

For neuertheleſſe it remayneth ſtyl in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very ſame ſymplicyte, as when it is ſhowed but in one alone: for when the negacion of a thyng, doth conſyſt in the mynd / and the voyce but an inſtrument to ſhowe it with all, and is not in dede the negacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelfe: clere it is, that then the thynge can neuer be twyſe denyed, excepte it be ons at leeſt graunted betwene: as thus / yf one ſholde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye the to be a trew man, ſo myght he do, and ſpeke neuer a worde / for euen ſo he doth, when he doth ons, but ſo thynke.

But the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in very ded it may be trewly ſayd, that he hath twyſe denied thy trauth, or els not: for ſo many tymes doth he thynke the no trewe man, as he doth bytwene eche tyme, thynke the contrary: but yf he neuer thynke the contrarye, then is all that, how longe ſo euer it endureth, but euen one thought, and one negacyon of thy trauth. Therfore all that whyle, how often ſo euer he do expreſſe it, or how dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly ſo euer he doth reherſe it, all is but the ſhowynge, of a thynge ſo longe denyed / and not of a thynge ſo often, or many tymes denyed. For yf I ſholde ſay this day / thou art no trewe man, and the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to morow, and alſo the next daye after / neuer thynkyng the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary

As one ſentence may be ſhowed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſed thryes, yet the ſame thryes ſhowyng or thryes reherſyng, doth not make it thre ſentences. For it is two thynges to ſhow the .xx. ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes what I denye: and to denye xx. tymes, that I ſhowe the, bycau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in the tone, there is .xx. negacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in the tother, there is but one. It ſhall not be therfore agayn this, that moſte men do thynke, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thynge, to be ſo often denyed, as they heare the negacyon therof, expreſſed and repreſented to theyr ears: for therin conſyder not they, whether it doth ſtyll contynue and abyde all one, as wel when it is not

expreſſed and ſhowed, but kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after within / as when it is mooſt manyfeſtely and openly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed. It is not alſo agayne this nother,<note place="margin">Luc. 22</note> that ſaynt Peter thryes de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyed chryſt: bycauſe that negacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was of an other kynd, then this is / for of that coude neuer folowe no chryſt, as it muſt nedes do of this. That was in dede but fayned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtynge in wordes onely, and not in the mynde. For all though it ſemed and ſo be ſayed, (as ryght well it may) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he denied chryſt: yet maye it be trewely ſumway ſayd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for he denied but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he knew hym. It is two thynges, for me to denye the, that is to ſaye, to denye what thou art, and to denye, that I know the. No heretyke doth denie that he knoweth chryſt (for all the maynye of them ſemeth to confeſſe
<pb facs="tcp:3749:42"/>
hym &amp; no men in maner ſo myche) but for all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, they do in dede denye what he is, whiche is ten tymes wors. Howbeit ſaynt Peter denied but that he knew hym, the whiche was but a fayned negacyon / &amp; dyd onely conſyſt in wordes: for it was otherwyſe in his mynde / bycauſe he dyd bothe thynke &amp; know, that he knewe hym / and dyd for fere but fayne the contrarye. wherfore all ſuch fayned negacyons which hath theyr beynges not in mynde / but onely in wordes, maye trewely be ſayd all way, to be ſo many, as they be ſondry tymes reherſed &amp; ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, But ſo maye not this hereticall ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gacyon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we now ſpeke of / whiche doth reſt in the mynde onely, mych more ſubtylly, mych more ſecretly, and therfore a thouſandfolde more dayngerouſly, then is poſſyble, for

the ineloquyble infyrmyte of the poſſeſſours &amp; hauers therof to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, or ſo mych as think for theyr owne partes. Now therfore, all this well conſydered, it is not hard to perceyue, that the denyenge of chryſte in one article, is (without any maner of intermyſſyon) as con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyne wall therin: as it is in .xx. arti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cles mo, or in them all / and what ſo euer is contyne wall, is nother mo nor fewer / nother oftener, nor ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domer, but vtterly all one. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore clene agayne thyn opinion, no oftener doth he denie chryſt, whych dyrectely denieth hym in all tharti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, then doth he, whiche directely denied hym but in one alone. what dyfference therfore (bycauſe this wyll not ſerue) canſt thou make els betwene them, but that the tone is euen yet this waye as euyll, as is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>All (as I perceyue) that moueth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this to thynke, is no more but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe mens conſyderacyon dothe abhorre, more hym then the tother. as good reaſon it is, that it ſholde ſo be, and yet in dede, is the tother, as euyll as he. For mans mynde is greued and troubled two maner of wayes, one with the thynge it ſelfe:
<pb facs="tcp:3749:50"/>
and an other with the man<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>er or cyr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumſtaunce of the ſame. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alſo, or the cyrcu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtaunce of it, doth ſomtyme make the thynge to be wors in dede, then it is of it ſelf, and therfore the more odyble to / &amp; ſomtyme it maketh it more odyble, and yet neuer the wors in dede, for all that: as after this enſample, it ſhal more playnly appere. Murder thou knoweſt, is of it ſelfe a thyng, which gretely doth offende and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the mynde of men / but yet yf one kyll a manne ſodenly, ere he be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ware of hym, comyng vppon hym preuelye by ſtelth, or ellys trayne hym with ſome fals flateryng pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſes, and therby conuaye hym, to ſome dayngerous place or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, where he is ſure he ſhall not ſchape hym, or by any ſuche other meanes, as he can make no maner
<pb facs="tcp:3749:50"/>
of ſhyfte, to ſoccur, helpe, or defend hym ſelfe. This maner or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, doth make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murder mych wors in dede, and therfore myche the more odyble to / then yf he had gyuen hym ſome warnynge or ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertye to ſhyfte for hym ſelfe: that is to ſaye, that yf he had kylde hym (as they call it) manfully / and not ſo lyke a coward and traytorouſly. Agayne alſo for the tother part / yf thou ſaweſt one kyll a man before thy face / and then hearde tell of an other, which alſo dyd the ſame lyke wyſe in an other place / thy mynde ſholde mych more abhore the tone then the tother / &amp; yet is there none of them both any wors then other: therfore all that, ryſeth by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thonely preſence of the tone done in thy ſyghte, whyche maketh a dyfference bytwen them, in thyne
<pb facs="tcp:3749:51"/>
eſtymacyon / and yet is there none bytwene them in dede. Alſo yf thou ſaweſt one ſtryke and hurte a man / and euen then, an other lykewyſe an other / wherof the tone dyeth by and by / and the tother halfe a yere after: The deth of the fyrſt, ſholde mych more greuouſly touche, and trouble thy mynde, then ſholde the tother, &amp; therfore moue the to take it wors, all though there be in the thyng no ſuch difference, nor cauſe why, of it ſelfe. But ſo cometh it to paſſe, by the preſent ſuddenneſſe, of the tone, whiche is not in the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe propertye is alwaye to put men (ſpecyally in odyble thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) rather in a paſſyon then in a iuſte iudgement: by the reaſon wherof they do take, that euyll ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte whiche foloweth his cauſe im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>medyately, and ſo toucheth theyr
<pb facs="tcp:3749:51"/>
cogytacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s at the fyrſt, to be mych wors then the tother of the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gre, which foloweth, as who ſay, by leyſour, crepyng lytell and lytell in to theyr knowlege at laſte: for the preſence, and alſo the ſuddenneſſe, of euery greuous euyll, is of ſuche properte, as doeth alwaye cauſe it to ſeme, and ſo therfore to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and taken, wors then when it is abſent and farder of, or when it cometh to knowlege leyſourly (as I ſayd) by meane at length. And yet is the thynge it ſelfe all one: for yf y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deth of hym, which dyeth halfe a yere after, myght come with the cauſe therof, ſo preſentely and ſo ſuddenly to thy knowlege, as the deth of hym doth, which dyeth by &amp; by, doutles thou ſholdeſt then take the laſt as greuouſly as the fyrſte, &amp; none other wyſe be mouyd with
<pb facs="tcp:3749:52"/>
the tone then the tother, but indyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently with them bothe / as thou art now, whyle I, as it were therof in dede, tell the the tale: for thou art I am ſure, no more moued now with the tone then the tother / and all bycauſe, they be bothe from, or to thy cogitacyon, of lyke dyſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. All this therfore, well perpended &amp; conſydered. Euen myche after the ſame maner, is the denyenge of chryſte dyrectely, and the denyeng of hym indirectly or conſequently: whiche be taken (in dede as thou ſayſt) the tone farre wors then the tother, not bycauſe it is ſo, but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a certeyne maner of cyrcu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, which cauſeth it but onely to ſeme ſo: for when I here any one artycle denyed (wherof it doth (as I ſayd) of neceſſyte alwaye folow, that chryſt is denyed in the ſame)
<pb facs="tcp:3749:52"/>
yf my cogytacyon coulde then, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reche and touche therin, the very ſame occult and ſecrete denyenge of chryſt, ſo clerly &amp; ſo manyfeſtly, ſo quyckely and ſo preſently, as it can the tother, when he is at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fyrſt directely and expreſſely denyed. Doutles I ſholde then, take it as greuouſly, as odybely, and iudge it iuſtly euen as euyl, as I do, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I heare hym denyed dyrectly with expreſſed wordes. But now by the reaſon that my conſyderacyon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can this waye, come fynally to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very thyng in dede, muſt fyrſte make therin a large progreſſyon, &amp; (as it were) a longe yourney to go. Fyrſt to conſyder tharticle denyed / and then that the trauth of chryſte is denyed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. Tyrdely, that chryſt and his trauth, are both our. Fynally that it muſte therof nedes
<pb facs="tcp:3749:53"/>
folow, that he therin is denied hym ſelfe / by the reaſon (I ſay) that my conſyderacyon, with this maner of mocyon and labor, halfe (as who ſaye) weryed and fatygate is (as it were) not ſo actyue and luſtye, but more week, dull, and vnapt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue vew and iudge, the thynge at length in thende, then it wolde haue ben, yf it had met, in maner, freſhly withall, at the fyrſt begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng. It doth therfore mych take the mater there after / &amp; all bycauſe it is not this waye, ſo eaſy &amp; reddy to come by, as it is the tother: for as men iudge alwaye, thoſe pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whiche be preſent, to be mych wors, then thoſe in euery degre, of as mych grefe, or the very ſame in dede, when they be abſent and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of. Euen ſo do they iudge that euyll, whiche is directely expreſſed,
<pb facs="tcp:3749:53"/>
to be wors, then an other in euery condicyon of the ſame degre, or the very ſame it ſelf, when it occupyeth the place of a conſequent, that is to ſay, when it is not directely expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but left to folow, and geuen of neceſſyte to be vnderſtand: for then it is fro mans cogitacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it were a great waye, and farre of, bycauſe it ſoundeth not in the earys ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and apertly, as when it is di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rectely expreſſed at the fyrſte. And therfore the mynde can not ſo take or touche it, vntyll it may, by a dew cource of thynges, from one to an o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther ordinatly, come to it at length. By the reaſon wherof it beginneth ſo leyſourly to appere to the mynd a farre of at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrſte, and then after nere and nere / that when it cometh, it bryngeth theyrwith, no maner of ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſſe, whiche can cauſe therin
<pb facs="tcp:3749:54"/>
any great perturbans or aſtonyſhe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, whoſe propertye is alway to gender diuerſyte of iudgement. Therfore this indyrect and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent denyenge of chryſt (which is in euery ſyngular article) doth alſo lye, or behaue it ſelfe to a mans co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyderacion, mych as doth a viſyble thynge to his eye, ſumwhat farder of, then is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune dew diſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of diſcernynge therof / or els, beyng in a lyght, ſumwhat more ſcant &amp; obſcure, then is apte for moſt men to perceyue it by. For the whiche, it is ſene, of ſome more, ſome leſſe, &amp; of ſome neuer a dele. And therfore it doth not draw mens iudgement therof, ſo perfytly vnto it, nor ſhow it ſelfe vnto them ſo clerely / as yf it ſtode nere, or in a more pure lyght. And euen very ſuch lyke is a conſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quens, wherof euery mans cogyta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon
<pb facs="tcp:3749:54"/>
is not lyke capax / but ſome more, ſome leſſe, and ſome nothyng at all, or very lyttell: and all, by the reaſon it lyeth ſomwhat beyonde, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comune iorney of moſte mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyderacyon / bycauſe it cometh not before in the face of the mater / but as who ſaye, in the backe ſyde of it, farre, as it were behynde, &amp; longe after. For the whiche, it doth not ſo vehemently moue the mynde that waye, as it doth the tother. And therfore men take it not ſo euyll; nor are ſo mych offended withall. But yf a mans cogitacyon were of ſuche abylyte, that it coulde as cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, as perfytely, and as ſwetly, ye rather as preſently touch and take a conſequent, that is to ſaye, that thynge, which of an other muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des folow, (&amp; that perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce longe after) as yf it were dyrectely expreſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:3749:55"/>
with apert wordes at the fyrſte. There is no dout, but then he that denyeth chryſt (as euery heretyke doth) but conſequently, ſhold ſone appere euyn as euyll, as he, whiche denieth hym with apert wordes di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rectely: for dyfference bytwen them is there none, but onely this yf any be. That the very ſame, which is at the fyrſt, with the tone, is euen alſo at the laſt with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tother: for where as the wordes of the tone, ſhoweth the denyeng of chryſt at the fyrſte / euen ſo doth the wordes of the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhowe the very ſame, at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> laſt. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou myghteſt clerely know that there is none other dyfference bytwene them, but onely thynſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fycyence of mans capacyte, whiche is not able to arreche them bothe lyke. Thou ſhalt not denye me this but euery thynge is vtterly none,
<pb facs="tcp:3749:55"/>
otherwyſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god doth know if: &amp; this is alſo ſure, that there can be no conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or folowyng of any thynge, in his knowlege: for what ſo euer is conſequent &amp; folowynge to vs, is without fayle before hym no leſſe appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but alſo as <g ref="char:abpre">p̄</g>ſent, not onely as that is, wherof it doth folow / but alſo as yf it ſelfe were di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rectely expreſſed at the fyrſt, or as any thyng els, is or may be, moſte <g ref="char:abpre">p̄</g>ſent &amp; manyfeſt vnto vs. wherin the powre and concept of our myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, doth (as I haue largely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) very gretely fayle, and is farre of.

            <sp>

               <p>No no, I wyſte full well, all this whyle, wherin thou woldeſt be clene deceyued. For be thou ryght well aſſured, that there is no man in all this worlde, that wolde denie chryſt, yf he were ware what he is. For ſo ware is he what chryſte is whiche denyeth hym directely: as he is ware, what his hole fayth is, whiche denieth all that directely. And ſo ware is he what his hole fayth is, which denieth all that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectely, as he is ware what one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of it is, whiche denieth but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> alone directly: and that alone doth he vtterly not knowe, nor ſo mych
<pb facs="tcp:3749:59"/>
as beleue nother. For ſure it is that yf he dyd, he wolde not denye it / no more therfore doth he the hole faith nor yet chryſt hym ſelfe, whiche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth hym and it, directly all togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: what wareneſſe or wyttyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therfore, is there here, more in the tone then the tother? Alſo there can no man be an heretyke, but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he denieth at leſte ſome one artycle of the fayth. And that wold he neuer do, but bycauſe he byle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vtterly that it is none, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it foloweth clerely, that he wold neuer denye it, yf he dyd know that it were one. For very mych more able, is the knowlege then the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue of any thynge, to let and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande the denyenge of it. Therfore loke what lacke, bothe of fayth and knowlege, he hath in one artycle, which diectly denieth but it alone. Euyn y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> very ſame hath he in both,
<pb facs="tcp:3749:60"/>
which denyeth twayne. And alſo in eche of them lykewyſe hath he, whiche doth denye thre / &amp; ſo forth after the ſame maner, from one to an other, tyll it come to hym, which directely denieth chryſt and them all. Therfore when he that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly denyeth chryſte and all his hole fayth, hath no more fayth nor knowledge of hym or it, then hath he, of that one article, which direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyeth but the ſame one a lone. what more warely or wyttyngly doth the tone then the tother, but euen lyke ignorauntly bothe? And beſyde this, clerely to knyt vp the mater withall. The knowledge of any thynge, is (as I ſayde) myche more able to let and reſtrayne the denienge therof, then is the fayth or byleue of it. But y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> faith of chryſt (as it is well knowen) maye be ſo great, that it wyll ſurely cauſe euen
<pb facs="tcp:3749:60"/>
this lyfe it ſelfe, with all the como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dytees therof, to be clene loſt &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, rather then to denye hym in any caſe. what wolde therfore the very knowlege of hym do, yf a man had that? when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> draweth, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandfolde more loue towarde hym, then all his fayth, in the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyt degre, is able to do. Moreouer when the greatneſſe of fayth, is of it ſelfe ſuffycyent &amp; able, to houlde and kepe, who ſo euer hath it, from the denyeng of chryſt in euere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dycyon. And when it is ſure alſo, that the very knowlege of hym, is therto mych more able then it is. How clerely doth it folow therof, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> who ſo euer denieth hym directely neuer doth it ware or wyttyngly? why therfore doeſt thou ſaye, that he, which dyrectely denyeth but the leſte part of the fayth, is not ſo euyl
<pb facs="tcp:3749:61"/>
as he, which dyrectly denieth chyrſt hymſelfe and all together, bycauſe although he denyeth conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly as mych as the tother doth, yet he doth it vnwars and ignorantly / &amp; the tother ware &amp; wyttyngly, when there is no ſuch mater or difference bytwene them, as thou thy ſelfe canſt now, I ſuppoſe, not choſe but perceyue? Therfore not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge this, or any other thyng els, which thou haſt hytherto ſayd to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary. I wyll yet ſay, as I ſayd at the fyrſt / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as great is his euyll, which directely denyeth but the leſt parte of the fayth / as his euyll is, which directely denyeth chryſt hym ſelfe and all togyther. As great I ſay, not in this or that reſpecte, but vtterly in euery condycyon / and in dyuers caſes (as I haue ſhewed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> before) alſo mych wors, not onely

towarde other, but alſo towarde hymſelfe. This dyfference bytwen them onely except, that the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, faſtly remayneth in the groſſe &amp; ignorant iudgement of the multy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude / the cauſe wherof I tolde the before (as it is in dede) euen to be this, that they do ſee openly, the hole euyll of the tone. And in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paryſon therof, obſcurely, ſo ſmall a parte of the tother / that ſome ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it more, ſome leſſe, ſome very lytell, &amp; ſome no euyll at all. what wonder therfore is it, all though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole clere trauth therof, be farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, from ſo great a dyuerſyte of ſuch a darke ignoraunce.</p>

Seynge it myghte chaunce to be (as of hym it is) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken otherwyſe, then the author dyd intende? other he knew or he knew not, that he ſholde ſo do, or ellys to take it for no ground or pryncyple to dyſpute vppon: yf he dyd not knowe it, that is to ſaye, that yf he dyd not knowe that a concluſyon can not be proued by any pryncy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whiche is incertayne.

<pb facs="tcp:3749:102"/>
it is agayne both nature &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to come by ſuerte, by incertitu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de: agayne of the tother part, yf he dyd know it, and yet wolde, as he dyd, tumble forth his argument ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uertheleſſe: what other thyng coud moue hym ſo to do, but onely wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full malyce.

Fryth had here no ſuche purpoſe. For he dyd not put it forth, to ſe what wolde be ſayd to the contrary or that it ſholde be lerned, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deceyt of it lay. But his intent was onely by the craftyneſſe therof, to draw men into his falſe and wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked opinyon. The whice he helde ſo vehemently to be trewe, that he layde therevpon no leſſe wayger, then his owne ſelfe, both body and ſoule, the loſſe of the whiche, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fayle is no leſſe lyke in bothe, then it is well knowne, to be ſure in the tone. Howbeit that ſhall paſſe, to come to our purpoſe agayne, the whiche is to ſhow, the great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or wylfull faſſhed of hym in his argument: for who, but he, wolde as who ſaye, ſo hedlynge at auenture, iudge ſ. Auſteyn (when he ſayth, the ſame fayth ſhall ſaue

For theſe two conſyderacions do mych dyffer in euery thynge. And that wonders playnly in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune law as thou dideſt euen now declare thy ſelfe. For in the conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracyon and reſpecte of the hole confuſely togyther, it is euen the ſame now that it was an hunderd yeres paſte, and was euen than the ſame that it is now, that is to ſaye, the law of england now, and none other then: the lawe of englande then &amp; none other now / the whiche word dothe ſygnyfaye all the hole thynge togyther, as it is at the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the ſpekynge of it, without any dyfference or any reſpecte of

For when thou heareſt it ſpoken it doeth put the no more in mynde of any one part, then of any other / but of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnite of them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyther, whiche the word doth only ſygnyfye. But the conſyderacyon of the ſame in partes dyſtynctely, doth farre dyffer from that. For in the reſpecte therof, it is not euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame now, that it was an. C. yeres paſte / nor the ſame then that it is now, by all thactes and ſtatutes which hath ben added vnto it ſyns yet can it not folow, but that it is the ſame law in generall ſtyll / for all the new partes which it had not before: alſo a tre beyng full of new leuys, twygges, brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches &amp; bowes, is yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame tre, that it was, yeres paſt before they ſpronge out of it / but how the ſame? the ſame in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte of the hole, but not the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:3749:104"/>
in reſpecte of euery parte / for ſome partes be new, but ſo are not all. yet before the new partes were ſprong out of it, it was none other nor yet no leſſe then the ſame tre, that it is afterwarde / and afterwarde none other nor yet no more, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame tre that it was before. Therfore as the tre, full of new partes, is euen the ſame tre that it was before / and yet not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame in euery poynt.

thynges that made the eares of the apoſtles ſo happy and bleſſed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearyng of them, but the ſayenges of chryſt? And why were thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes and iuſte men deſyrous to heare them, and hearde them not, but bycauſe they were neuer ſayde in theyr tyme?

But they were not bounde vnder payne of dampnacyon to byleue, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of baptyme is a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Therfore it ſhall not folow that we are bound therto vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> payne of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pnacyon. The fyrſt part of myne

The ſeconde part is ſo manyfeſt that it nedeth no ꝓ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacyon. For how coude they beleue that thynge, which was neuer ſayd nor done: and without the worde they coude haue no fayth. Uppon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trauth of theſe two partes, muſte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſyon nedes folow: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is this / that we are not bounde to by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, that the ſacrament of baptym is a ſacrament. And euen by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me argument, that the bleſſed ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of the aulter, is not ſo myche as a ſacrament nother: and other dyuerſe lyke wyſe / ſo, we are (as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man knoweth) bounde all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the payne of dampnacyon, to receyue the ſacrament of baptyme, but yet we be not bounde to byleue it / that is to ſaye, we are not bound

to byleue the ſame thynge, whiche we are bounde to receyue. when the iuſt rule is this, that looke of what neceſſyte the thynge is to be had / of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame neceſſyte, it is to be byle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But thou mayſte ſe, what a fayth this mans argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teacheth vs, ſo new and ſtraunge as I dare well ſaye, neuer trew chryſten man was aqueynted withall: yet let vs beholde, the patturne of it in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cace, ones agayne / and ſo (as they ſay) bleſſe vs clene from it for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>euer. The ſame fayth ſhall ſaue vs which ſaued the olde fathers before chryſtes incarnacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes dyſperſed now in chryſtendome (as in Rome and in other places) haue the ſame fayth, whiche the olde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had before chryſtes incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon. Therfore it ſhall folowe, that the ſame fayth ſhall ſaue vs, which
<pb facs="tcp:3749:114"/>
theſe Iewes hath now. The fyrſte part of myn argument, (after Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes vnderſtandynge of hym) is ꝓ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by ſaynt Auſteyn ad Dardanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c. The ſecond part is ſo manyfeſt, that it nedeth no probacyon. For the credence of ſo many, no lyght perſons, but of ſobre wyttes and good lernyng bothe, as hath come from Rome &amp; other places (where the Iewes be now abydynge) and hath made report here amonge vs, not onely of theyr fayth to be the ſame, whiche was the olde fathers but alſo of theyr excedynge dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens, wherewith they ceſſe not to kepe and obſerue the olde law and the ceremonyes therof / inſtructyng teachyng and bryngynge vp theyr chylderne in ſuche maner therin, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be thought, more ꝓmpt reddy and perfyt in the olde teſtament, at

heuen, of the which they byleue not ſo myche as any one. Iudge now thy ſelfe, whether this be falſe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyke, or trewe ſophyſtrye: ye rather the very fayth or abhomynable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſye: is it not a proper argument whiche can ſo trye oure dewtye in euery artycle, from one to an other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without parell we maye leue our byleue of them all togyther? for ſurely and without any dout, loke how mych it maketh agayne this artycle, whiche he wold ouerthrow yf he myght.

<pb facs="tcp:3749:121"/>
it nothynge to ſay, it abydeth, and to ſaye it abydeth one? A man of .iiii. ſcore yeres, ſo longe abydeth but yet ſo longe he abideth not one, for he is one thynge before ten or xii. yeres of age, the which he is not after .xxiiii. and an other at .lxxx. which he was not at .xxx. for fyrſte a yonge tender chyld increaſynge, and after a luſty man at his full ſtrength: but at laſt, a feble impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſon almoſt wytherd awaye / and therfore i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe caces he abideth not one but rather another &amp; another, &amp; ſo furth in many other lyke. This ſame worde, one, Fryth doeth not here put it to ſygnyfie, as doth, one which is the fyrſte begynnynge of number / but he doth put it to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfye, none other then doth this ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me worde / the ſame / And this ſame worde / the ſame / ſemeth all waye

(as I tolde the before that he both and wolde haue it taken) to ſigny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye the ſame, without any maner of dyfference. As in very dede ſo doth it, in that reſpect onely, wherof it is ment. But that myſſed and wrong taken (as no maruel why that very oft tymes it is ſo in dede) then doth it mych deceyue and nothynge els. Therfore where he doth put in this ſame worde, one, doutles he myght as well haue put i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this ſame word the ſame: But that he wold not do, leſt by the reaſon therof, it ſhold be the ſoner ſpyed, that euen onely therin, doeth reſte all his hole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, of brynging his purpoſe to paſſe, bycauſe he is alway ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſye therwith, that euery man may ſoone ſee, that he nother doth, nor yet can, clayme any thynge for hym of ſaynt Auſteyn, but onely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word
<pb facs="tcp:3749:122"/>
And therfore in the ſtede therof, to colour the mater, as with ſome dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſyte, he wolde ſtele in, this word one / to make another ſound in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s cares, but yet none other ſignifyca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon in theyr myndes: for truſt me trewly, he hath no maner of thyng, of faynt Auſteyn, or any other (whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che is none / but onely ſaynt Beda in the wordes before reherſed) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can ſo mych as ſeme, to make any beke towarde this part of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but onely this ſame word the ſame / catche it where he can: And that is the very cauſe why, that he cleuyth euen ſo faſte and erneſtlye vnto it, where ſo euer he can fynde it. But where he can not, yet yf he may, ſpye any corner of a ſentence where it may but ſcant ſeme, to be ſufferd yf it were put to it.

               <p>Then ſyr is it not yet as good we be talkynge in our way, for the whyle as aught els.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>yes &amp; I am very well pleaſed therwithall, yf thou haſt any thyng

to ſay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>He.</speaker>
               <p>yes marry ſyr, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue I, &amp; that is thys, I wold fayne know, by what reaſon you can proue, that this ſame article, whiche we haue ben about all this whyle, is one of them, which we be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of neceſſite to beleue: ye haue hytherto labord to improue Fryth, for holdyng the contrary: but yet haue you done vtterly nothynge to the probacyon of it your ſelfs / for it is two thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to proue Frythes opinion fals, and to proue your owne trewe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Troweſt thou ſo?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>He.</speaker>
               <p>I thynke ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>well all though the probacyon of the trauth, can not haue his very apt and moſt conuenient place, tyll the falſhed be clene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>efelled and thorouly put away, and that in the hole, as it is nowe, but in the fyrſte part onely. yet all voyde of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt / wyll I not leue the, bycauſe
<pb facs="tcp:3749:154"/>
I ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſomwhat deſyrous to heare of the mater. And therfore whyle Frythes opinion is this, that it is an artycle but indyffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and of no neceſſite for to be beleued: and ours clene &amp; dyrectely the contrary. For the which the tone parte or the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſte nedes be trew: it muſte therfore clerely folow, bycauſe the falſhed is found of his ſyde playn, that vtterly the trauth remayneth with vs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>He.</speaker>
               <p>Nay ſyr that foloweth not. For the falſhed that is founde with Fryth, is in his probacyon, &amp; not in the thynge, whiche he goeth about to proue. For ye know ryght well, that a man maye myſſe in the probacyon of a trewe thynge ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme, yet is not the thyng fals, by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe the probacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not trew.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Thus mayſt y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> excuſe euery falſhed which any fals harlot goeth about
<pb facs="tcp:3749:155"/>
to proue trew. For ſone mayſt thou ſaye, all though he fayle in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacyon: yet is the thynge trewe ynough / bycauſe a man may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued in the probacyon of a trewe thynge: when in dede the falſhed of a thynge, is oft tymes more then halfe dyſcloſed / euen by the falſhed of the probacyon therof, it beynge ons perceyued. Therfore although the manyfeſt falſhed of frythes ꝓ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacyons, do not euen very dyrectly proue, the falſhed of his opinion. yet maketh it at the leſt an ineuyta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble coniecture therof. And eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as mych for the trauth, of oure ſyde. For what doeth this thynge ſhow, that all the reaſons that he doeth make, or is able to yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyon for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe, doth not onely not proue his intent, but alſo draw with them ſuch odible conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces
<pb facs="tcp:3749:155"/>
beſyde, as no good cryſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eare, wyll not excedyngly abhorre to heare. what doth all this (I ſay) ſhow, but that the myghty and inuincyble trauth of the contrary part, wyll in no caſe ſuffre it ſelfe to be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? Moreouer what wylt thou ſey yf Fryth do ſuffycyently proue our parte hym ſelfe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>He.</speaker>
               <p>what ſyr it can neuer be, for all his hole purpoſe is vtterly to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>yet marke hym well / for he intendyng in dede to proue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary, maketh neuer a reaſon, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> (as I haue playnly declared vnto the) it ronneth euen vtterly, as mych agayne the neceſſy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te of any &amp; euery other artycle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyde, as it doth agayn this, for the which he dyd purpoſe it. And that were not poſſyble except this were one of of them, and of the ſelf ſame nature that they be. For how ſhold
<pb facs="tcp:3749:156"/>
any of his reaſons purpoſed agayn the neceſſyte of this artycle onely, touche the neceſſyte of all or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lykewyſe / more then they tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the lyght of the ſonne, the heate of the fyre, or the hardenes of dya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondes, and other lyke / beynge no more purpoſed agayne thoſe arty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, then agayn theſe thynges / but vtterly bycauſe thoſe articles, and this, agayne the whiche they were purpoſed by all one &amp; of the ſelfe ſame nature. And theſe thynges, eche of them clene of an other? For what ſo euer reaſon is purpoſed with or agayne any thyng, ſo farre doth it alwaye ronne, as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite of the nature of the thyng doth exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, &amp; no fardyr. As be it in caſe, that one wolde take vpon hym, to proue or improue, thy ſoule only to be immortall / what ſo euer reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:3749:156"/>
he ſholde make with or agayne it / without fayle muſt nedes ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne lyke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wyſe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoules of all men beſyde: and that were not poſſyble, yf that immortalyte were not comune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene theyr ſoules and thyne. And after the ſame maner / y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> cauſe why that Frythes reaſons doth ronne as well agayne the neceſſyte of all other artycles, as it doth agayne this, for the which they were purpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed, is vtterly bycauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very ſame neceſſyte is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune bytwene them and this / for els, it were not poſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for thoſe reaſons purpoſed but onely agayne this / to make any thyng agayne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neceſſyte of thoſe / more then agayne (as I ſayde) the lyght of the ſonne, or any thyng els beſyde: wherfore it muſt nedes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that this artycle is of as great neceſſyte to be beleued as any other
<pb facs="tcp:3749:157"/>
And therfore where Fryth wolde haue proued it indyfferent &amp; coude not: he hath well proued it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and wolde not. Thou getteſt no more now.</p>
